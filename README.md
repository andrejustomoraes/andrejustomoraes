## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey! Iâ€™m AndrÃ©, and Iâ€™m just starting out on my programming journey. ðŸ’» Iâ€™m into Python, JavaScript, Java, and more, and Iâ€™m pumped to dive into open-source projects and level up my skills.

Right now, Iâ€™m learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™d love to work on projects thatâ€™ll help me grow as a developer. ðŸš€

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m into reading, gaming, binging shows, running RPGs, and watching the NFL. Always down for tips and advice, so feel free to shoot me a message!

Letâ€™s build something awesome together!
